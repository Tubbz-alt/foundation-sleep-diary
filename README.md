# [Foundation Sleep Diary](https://wesinator.github.io/foundation-sleep-diary/)

A client-side, frontend sleep diary application built using [Foundation](https://get.foundation/). Meant to be easier to use than fillable PDFs.

Based on the following sleep diary PDF form templates:
  - https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/sleep-diary
  - https://www.sleepfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SleepDiaryv6.pdf

Printable from browser for saving.

24-hour time is used for hours, to avoid dealing with AM/PM.
